  <h1>Cholera: Causes, Symptoms, and Prevention</h1>

  <img src="images/cholera.jpg" alt="Cholera bacteria under microscope" />

  <p><strong>Cholera</strong> is an acute diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>. It is usually transmitted through contaminated water or food. Cholera can cause severe dehydration and even death if not treated promptly.</p>
  <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> of cholera include watery diarrhea, vomiting, and rapid dehydration. The disease can spread rapidly in areas with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water.</p>

  <p><strong>Prevention</strong> measures include drinking clean water, proper sanitation, and good hygiene practices. Vaccination is also available in some regions to help control outbreaks.</p>

  <p>If you suspect cholera infection, seek medical attention immediately. Rehydration therapy and antibiotics are effective treatments.</p>
